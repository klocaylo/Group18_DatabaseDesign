# Group18_DatabaseDesign
## Introduction
### Project Description
For this project, my group and I were tasked with understanding and enhancing a database system, utilizing MySQL, that is a campus controlled food delivery service (similar to craveoncampus.com which was created due to the changes COVID-19 caused). Regarding the enhancements of the database, we were responsible for adding a rating system for the restaurants and the delivery drivers.
